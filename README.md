  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

  ## This project allows the user to interact with an employee database that houses information about every included employee, while also allowing for the information to be manipulated or for future employees/information to be created.

  - My motivation for this project was to develop a database that would house employees of a company and allow for the user to manipulate their details or for the user to add new employees in the future.
  - I built this project as a challenge to learn more about SQL and its functions, as well as the npm pg package that will allow for typescript to communicate with SQL. 
  - This project solves the potential problem that a corperation may have with keeping track of their employees and their information in an efficient manner. This also solves problems with having to code more employees directly into SQL itself, as this is a command-line application that is easy to interact with.
  - During the development of this project, I learned much about the functionality of SQL and the capabilities it posesses. Additionally, I learned how typescript can communicate with SQL to create an application as such, as well as develop a lot of other interesting and useful applications.
